# Unsupervised anomaly detection in 3d volumetric MRI/CT scan 

## Overview
This repository contains the complete implementation of our project, including code files, trained models, and the interface.

## Getting Started
### Dataset Information

#### Training Dataset: **OpenBHB**
- **Description**: OpenBHB (Open Brain Health Dataset) is used as the primary dataset for training the model.
- **Purpose**: Provides a robust dataset for learning normal patterns in brain MRI volumes.
- **Link**: [OpenBHB Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahulkumargop/openbhb/data)

#### Testing Dataset: **BraTS 2020**
- **Description**: The BraTS 2020 (Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge) dataset is utilized for anomaly detection testing.
- **Purpose**: Contains annotated brain MRIs, allowing evaluation of the model's anomaly detection capabilities, such as identifying tumors.

### Model Training

- **Trained Model**: [Link]()
- **To Train**: Download any provided notebook, upload the dataset, and execute the notebook to train the model.

## Getting Started with GUI

Follow these steps to set up and run the GUI for the MRI Viewer and Analysis Tool:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-link>
```
### 2. Navigate to the GUI Directory

Change your working directory to the folder containing the GUI files:
```bash
cd <repository-folder>/GUI
```

### 3. Prerequisite: Install Python 3.8
Ensure you have Python 3.8 installed on your system. 

### 4. Install Required Dependencies
Install all necessary Python packages using the requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

###5. Run the Application
Launch the GUI by running the main application file:
```bash
python tk_app.py
